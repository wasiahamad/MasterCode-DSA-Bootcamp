# MasterCode-DSA-Bootcamp

Welcome to the **MasterCode DSA Bootcamp** repository! This project is aimed at helping learners master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through practical implementation and problem-solving exercises in **Java**. Each day, youâ€™ll find new coding exercises, implementations, and explanations of various DSA concepts.

---

## Purpose

The main goal of this bootcamp is to:
1. Build a strong foundation in data structures like **stacks, queues, linked lists**, and **deques**.
2. Provide **coding challenges** with solutions to help you practice daily and improve your problem-solving abilities.
3. Prepare for technical interviews by solving real-world DSA problems.

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you are familiar with:
- **Basic Java programming** concepts.
- Fundamental **data structures** such as arrays, stacks, and queues.
- Basic **algorithmic concepts** like recursion, sorting, and searching.

Having a basic understanding of these concepts will help you get the most out of this bootcamp.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by **days**. Each day, a new problem or concept is covered, and a solution is provided in Java.

### Folder Structure:

### Day 1: [ Implement stack using array](Day1.java)
**Description**
- Learn the basics of the Stack data structure.
- Implementation of basic stack operations such as push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty().

### Day 2: [ Implement Queue using array](Day2.java)
**Description**
- Introduction to the Queue data structure.
- Simple queue implementation using arrays.
- Operations like enqueue(), dequeue(), and peek().
- Additional queue problems to further reinforce the understanding of queues.
